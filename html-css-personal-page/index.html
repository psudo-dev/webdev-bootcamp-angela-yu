      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="description">I've graduated at UNICAMP, with a major in Midialogia, a Social Communication course. But I
        also did several project classes at FAU-USP along the Design students. I've done illustration since I was little
        so, I also got some freelance jobs doing Illustration, just as I did some freelance for Graphic Design and Video
        in the past years. Now I'm starting to do some programming too.</p>

      <h3>Videographer</h3>
      <p>I prefer directing and filming but usually I'm a one-man-crew, so I do the whole thing from Lighting to Audio,
        including Editing and some Post-Production.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Photographer</h3>
      <p>I've done some Product Photography here and there but I wouldn't call myself a Pro in this department. I prefer
        Landscape, Portrait and Street Photography.</p>

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>I've done a few works for small business, from Visual Identity to some Web Design. I'm a capable Designer but
        it's not really my passion and in the Design area, I would prefer Product Design and I would love to design my
        own furniture.</p>

      <h3>Illustration</h3>
      <p>As I've done some drawing since I was little, eventually I've got some freelance work for Illustration but you
        can consider this more like a Hobby. I also need to train some more to ever consider myself a Pro.</p>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>I'm starting to get into Web Development. After doing some reasearch and taking advantage of my Designer side,
        I've decided to start with HTML, CSS and Javascript and we'll see how it goes from here, right?</p>
