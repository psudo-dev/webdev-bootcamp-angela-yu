## About <a name = "about"></a>

A lot of times I make changes to the course projects and exercises, I try some new things, add something here and there or even extrapolate to something different.

I know that there are several projects alike from Internet courses and tutorials out there so I will only document the tests I've done and the things I've changed.

## Status <a name = "status"></a>

I only did the HTML and CSS parts of the course. I intend to get back to it for the back-end and Javascript frameworks parts in the future.
